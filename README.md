# Scraping-tool-
Script that scrapes event information and enriches this data from Google search results.
Make sure to replace event_url with the URL of the event you want to scrape from Eventbrite. This script will scrape the event details, perform a Google search for each event, extract relevant information from the search results, and save the enriched data in a JSON file named events.json. You can run this script using Python 3.
